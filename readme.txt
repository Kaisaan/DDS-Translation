Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei (MSX) Translation by Kaisaan

Info on the game:
This game is different from Atlus' take on Aya Nishitani's Digial Devil Story novels and instead was developped by Telenet. I decided to go and make a translation hack for this game since nobody else has lol.
Most of the information (hacking notes, translation notes, and general game info) can be found at https://github.com/Kaisaan/DDS-Translation

Changelog:
Hack version 1.0:
- Initial release

Patching instructions:
Patch DDSE.bps with whatever .bps patcher of your choice with a ROM with a CRC-32 of 25FC11FA

Help Wanted:
While this game has been fully translated, I would like to do more. If you are...
- Knowledgable in Z80 assembly with the MSX, I need to still figure out how the password system works (and possibly make a password generator for this game)
- Knowledgable in ROM hacking for the PC-88, Sharp X1, or FM-7, I'd like to get the other releases of this game translated
- Have physical copies of the manual and are able to scan it, I'd like to get a higher quality scan of the manual than what can be found online
- Able to translate Japanese, I would like to get the game's manual translated as the people that helped me with this game's translation are busy with other projects now
...Please reach out to me! I listed a few ways to contact me online down below.

Bug Reports:
If you find any issues with this hack or any any questions about the game itself, feel free to contact me with the info before:Passwords should work the same between the original version and this translation patch, so verify that this is an issue specific to the hack.
